# Task 05 â€” Establish frontend design system baseline

Branch Name: task/05-establish-design-system-baseline

## Background and Motivation
Establish the frontend design system baseline: apply tokens/typography (Nunito 400/600/700), set radius 12px, and implement focus-visible rings. Ensure the dashboard shell meets AA contrast, there are no console style warnings, and hot reload works. Refs: `docs/frontend_guidelines_document.md`, `docs/app_flow_document.md`.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- _TBD by Planner/Executor_

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Create branch `task/05-establish-design-system-baseline` from `main`.
2. Add Nunito font (400/600/700) and wire it into the app.
3. Define and apply design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) including 12px border radius.
4. Implement focus-visible rings across interactive components.
5. Apply tokens to the dashboard shell and core UI components.
6. Validate AA contrast for the dashboard shell and primary UI surfaces.
7. Verify there are no console style warnings and hot reload works.
8. Verify acceptance criteria.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Tokens/typography applied (Nunito 400/600/700), 12px radius, focus-visible rings.
- Dashboard shell meets AA contrast.
- No console style warnings.
- Hot reload works.
