# Task 16 â€” Enforce summarization rate limit

Branch Name: task/16-enforce-rate-limit

## Background and Motivation
Enforce rate limit: maximum 100 summaries/user/day (UTC reset); on exceed, return `rate_limited`.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Accurate daily reset at UTC midnight.
- Persisting counters across server restarts.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Create branch `task/16-enforce-rate-limit` from `main`.
2. Implement rate limit logic within summarization action pipeline.
3. Store per-user counters and reset at UTC midnight.
4. Write tests to cover limit enforcement and reset.
5. Verify acceptance criteria.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Counter persists across restarts.
- Counter resets at midnight UTC.
