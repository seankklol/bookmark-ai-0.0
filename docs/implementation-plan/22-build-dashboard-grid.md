# Task 22 — Build dashboard grid

Branch Name: task/22-build-dashboard-grid

## Background and Motivation
Build dashboard grid: fixed 16:9 cards (desktop ~240×135 / mobile ~160×90), fields: thumbnail/icon, title, clickable URL (later via `/r/:id`), date. Default sort: `clickCount desc → createdAt desc`.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Responsive design maintaining fixed aspect ratio.
- Server-side sorting consistency.

## High-level Task Breakdown

3. Ensure default sort order applied via query.
4. Seed data and verify sorting.
5. Verify acceptance criteria.

### Acceptance Criteria
