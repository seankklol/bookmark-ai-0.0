# Task 24 — Add optimistic states on card

Branch Name: task/24-add-optimistic-states

## Background and Motivation
Add optimistic states on card: “Fetching… → Summarizing…” then morph animation on success; Error chip + Retry button on failure.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Coordinating state transitions with real backend events.
- Smooth morph animations.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Create branch `task/24-add-optimistic-states` from `main`.
2. Implement frontend state machine representing ingest pipeline states.
3. Add morph animation between states.
4. Add error chip and Retry handler.
5. Verify acceptance criteria.

### Acceptance Criteria
- State transitions visible within one flow.
