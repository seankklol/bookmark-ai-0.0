# Task 33 — Apply final cutoff rule

Branch Name: task/33-apply-final-cutoff-rule

## Background and Motivation
Apply final cutoff rule: include items with cosine ≥ 0.22 OR ≥ 70% of top hit; no hard cap.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Dynamic threshold relative to top score.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Create branch `task/33-apply-final-cutoff-rule` from `main`.
2. Implement cutoff filtering after MMR.
3. Write synthetic tests verifying threshold behavior.
4. Verify acceptance criteria.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Synthetic test verifies threshold behavior.
